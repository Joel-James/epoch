<h1>Engage your readers at their own pace with 100% email-based commenting</h1>
<h3>The days of one-way notifications are over. It’s time to let them hit reply.</h3>
<p>Increased engagement is just the natural result when you make it easy for your readers to be a part of the conversation.</p>

<p>Postmatic lets your readers subscribe by email when they leave a comment. Subsequent comments and replies will land in their inbox, just like with <em>Jetpack</em> or <em>Subscribe to Comments</em>. <strong>Except now with Postmatic, they can comment back and keep the conversation going just by hitting reply</strong>. They never have to leave their inbox.</p>

<p>Online or offline, everyone stays in the loop—regardless of web, desktop or mobile.</p>
