<h2>Commenting Perfected - brought to you by Postmatic</h2>

<h2>What Epoch Does</h2>
<p>In a nutshell: <strong>Epoch makes commenting <em>fun</em> again.</strong>. <em>Espcially when you combine it with <a href="http://gopostmatic.com">Postmatic</a>.</em></p>
<div class="column">
<h3>Fixes The Commenting User Experience</h3>
Comment forms and display are often neglected by theme developers. We've been there ourselves. The functions and templates involved in WordPress commenting are complicated, frustrating, and no fun to work with. Every day we see fantastic themes with ridiculously poor commenting experiences. So that's the first thing Epoch fixes.

<strong>Epoch is now overrideing your native comment templates with a simple, elegant, and highly usable experience.</strong>

<div class="column">
<h3>Enables Insanely Fast Realtime Commenting</h3>
No more submitting comments and watching the page reload. All Epoch comments are submitted via ajax and post instantly in their proper place within the conversation.

And, as it should be, new comments from other users show up like magic automatically. It doesn't matter if they are posted from the web, or from email via <a href="http://gopostmatic.com">Postmatic</a>. The conversation is instantly updated.
</div>

<div class="column">
<h3>With Cacheing, CDN's and Modern Host Support</h3>
Epoch is hands down the fastest commenting system available for WordPress, all the while supporting page cacheing and CDNs.Epoch comments lazy load into a placeholder container only when needed. This means your post will load instantly, your comments will load instantly, and your server won't blink. And no, we don't use iframes. Your full SEO mojo is in tact.

<h2 class="clear">Free Addons and Recommended Plugins</h2>
Epoch is built for compatibility. Just like <a href="http://gopostmatic.com">Postmatic</a>. It uses fully native WordPress commenting, plays nicely with most all other commenting plugins, and employs WordPress coding standards.

It'll work seamlessly with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/zero-spam/">WordPress Zero Spam</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-recaptcha/">WP-reCaptcha</a>, and <a href="http://akismet.com">Akismet</a>. That should take care of things.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Support for <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-social-login/">WordPress Social Login</a> is built in and ready to go. Users can sign in with any of a dozen different social networks and services.</p>
</div>

<div class="column">

<h3>Want to jump into the ring?</h3>
This is just 1.0. We're hoping the WordPress community will lend strength, ideas, and code to this project. That's why we've kept it open-source. You can find Epoch on Github and jump right in. We can't wait to see where commenting goes next.
